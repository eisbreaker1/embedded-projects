This is a repository to store some of my projects

1. Steper motor for biomedical applications+
   
   First project included creating a platform for a stepper motor, with the A4988 stepper driver. Then I created a library that
   contained functions for different medical devices such as infusion pump, insulin pump, or chemical analyzer.

3. Pulse detection using MAX30100 sensor

   The MAX30100 sensor ouputs raw data from two phototransistors, correlating to the infrared and red light. In this project I've written library for this sensor
   and applied different filters to the signal. Then i wrote a simple state machine, used to calculate the BPM value, that was next output to the OLED display.
